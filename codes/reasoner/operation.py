action_generation_prompt = """
You are a decision-making agent. 
Your primary goal is to detect the resolved question in the `subquestions` list and select the next **ALLOWED ACTION** to process it.
You MUST reference the `action history` to determine which questions have not yet been fully broken down.

ALLOWED ACTIONS (choose exactly one):
- infer_calculation_formula
- multihop_question_decomposition
- generate_execute_program

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1.  **Target Selection:** The resolved question as rules 1), 2) and 3).
2.  **Function Parameter:** For `infer_calculation_formula` and `multihop_question_decomposition`, the **first parameter MUST be the chosen Target Subquestion ID.**
3.  **New IDs:** If you select `infer_calculation_formula` or `multihop_question_decomposition`, you MUST generate **new subquestion IDs** (e.g., #11, #12, #13) that have not been used previously.

RULES
1) If the target subquestion is directly executable from the table schema:
   → Use generate_execute_program.
   Directly executable means you can answer the question by identifying the needed row header(s) and column header(s) from `table metadata` WITHOUT:
   - deriving a math formula, AND
   - requiring an intermediate hop/selection.

   Example
   subquestions: {{"raw": "What is the sum of Entergy Arkansas in First Quarter in 2015?"}}
   table metadata: {{"row_headers": ["Entergy Arkansas","Entergy Louisiana"],
                    "column_headers": ["2015: First Quarter","2016: First Quarter"]}}
   action history: []
   Function:
     generate_execute_program()
   Explanation: Simple aggregation after retrieving the values from "Entergy Arkansas" and "2015: First Quarter"; no decomposition or complex formula needed.

2) If the **Target Subquestion** requires a **MATH FORMULA** derived from the prefined operator set below:
    **Operator Set:**
      {operator_set}
   → Use **infer_calculation_formula**.
   The formula must:
   - Use ONLY placeholders (#1, #2, #3, …).
   - Be composed using only operators selected from the **Operator Set**.
   - Map each placeholder to exactly ONE scalar-fetch description from the table.
   
   Use the **minimal formula** that correctly answers the question.
   If a single operator suffices, do NOT decompose further.


   {dataset_specific_example}

3) If the **Target Subquestion** is a **multi-hop question**
   → Call multihop_question_decomposition.
   - order lists the execution sequence of smaller single-hop question (each hop requires a reasoning step, at most 3 reasoning steps)
   - `subquestions` defines each new single-hop question; later ones reference earlier ones.

   Example
   subquestions: {{"#1": "What is Entergy Louisiana in First Quarter in the year with higher Entergy Arkansas?"}}
   table metadata: {{"row_headers": ["Entergy Arkansas","Entergy Louisiana"],
                    "column_headers": ["2015: First Quarter","2016: First Quarter"]}}
   action history: []
   Function:
     multihop_question_decomposition(
       "#1", /* Chosen Target ID used here */
       ["#11","#12"],
       {{
         "#11": "Which year has the higher value for Entergy Arkansas in First Quarter?",
         "#12": "What is Entergy Louisiana in First Quarter for the year selected by #11?"
       }}
     )
   Explanation: The target subquestion #1 is multi-hop question. To answer #1, you should first find the year by answering #11, then fetch the requested value to answer #12 conditioned on the result from #11.

### Data Handling and Pandas Constraints

* **Explicit DataFrame Construction:** Construct a **minimal** DataFrame (named `df`, `df_q1`, etc.) **explicitly** using `pd.DataFrame` from a Python dictionary. Use data **ONLY** from the **Relevant subtable**.
    * **Data Normalization:** Safely transform and normalize non-standard text data (e.g., commas, %, currency symbols) into standard numerical values (`float` or `int`) when defining the dictionary lists.
    * **Format:** `df = pd.DataFrame({{"Exact Column Header": [<value1>, <value2>], ...}})`
    
* **Data Selection:** Include **only** the columns and rows required for the current computation.
* **Mandatory Filtering (Anti-Pattern Avoidance):** You **MUST** include code to filter out all semantically irrelevant entries (e.g., **"Total"**, "Subtotal", grand totals, or summary rows) immediately after DataFrame construction, if such entries are present in the source data and would interfere with aggregation.

Example of Filtering and Calculation:
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({{
  "Category": ["State", "Federal", "Total"],
  "Value": [100, 200, 300]
}})
df = df[df["Category"] != "Total"]
final_answer = df["Value"].sum()
